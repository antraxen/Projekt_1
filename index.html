To potentially help them lighten up their frustrations of not understanding the subject, by playing in their own field - The gaming field! By interacting with the children in the gaming field, we make the lessons more exciting and also more </p></div></li>

        <li><div class="theconcepttekst"><h3>THE CONCEPT</h3><p>The concept is to build a minigame specifict for the subject that is being taught in class, through Virutal Reality. Let’s say for example a block game where they must learn multiplying – Then to complete their task, they’ll have to move blocks that has numbers on them and move them in the right position.<br><br>So every time they complete a task, they move up in the system can get harder equations concerning the subject. If they fail to complete the equation they will move down in the system and have easier calculations and a guide step by step to help them in the right direction.</p></div></li>
